       <h2 >WHAT IS CORONAVIRUS?</h2>
       <p class="faded">
		Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

       <h2>SYMPTOMS:</h2>
       <p class="faded">
		The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are <mark>fever</mark>, <mark>dry cough</mark>, and <mark> tiredness</mark>. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes.
	</p>
	 <p class="faded">
		Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. 
	</p>

	<div class="container-fluid" style="background: #D3D3D3;">
       <h2>HOW DOES IT SPREAD?</h2>
       <p class="faded">
		People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container-fluid" style="background: #D3D3D3;">
       <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
       <p>

			<ul class="list-group">

				<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Maintain at least <mark> 1 metre</mark> distance between yourself and others.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Avoid going to crowded places. </li>
